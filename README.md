Small lil hack away project who's objective was to make the world slowest kinect. 
Designed to work inside a raspberry-pi cero that controls 2 servos of a robotic arm I made out of a Amazon cardboard box with a depth sensor attached. 

It scans a 2d range of angles and records the depth that the ultrasound reports.

Turns out the depth sensor has a horrible precision. About 10 degrees + noise. Furthermore diferent surfaces disperse ultrasound differently, so not a great success. you can see my results in the txt files, but don't spect to be impressed.

The results are presented as datauri, you can translate them to images copying them into any browser's search bar.
